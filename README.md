Welcome to the ChatGPT Conversations to Markdown converter! This Python script helps you to convert your entire ChatGPT history and data export into neatly formatted Markdown files.

It adds **YAML** headers (_optional, included by default_), and also includes **Code interpreter** (Advanced Data Analysis) input / output.

**New :** Data visualizations, and custom instructions.

## Quick setup

> See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). (Just Python and Git, and you're good to go.)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository üì•

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamed-chs/chatgpt-history-export-to-md.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory by using the following command:

```bash
cd chatgpt-history-export-to-md
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment üõ†Ô∏è

Before running the script, you need to set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

First, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

#### On Windows:

Using Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`):

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Or, if you're using PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If you encounter an error about script execution in PowerShell, try running:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### On Linux or MacOS:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After activation, install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download Your Conversations data üóÇ

Before you run the script, make sure your ChatGPT conversations are in a ZIP file format.

The script will automatically find the most recent ZIP file in your 'Downloads' directory (in `~/Downloads/`), but you can specify a different file or location if necessary.

### Step 4: Running the Script üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

With the environment set up, you can now run the script. In the terminal or command prompt, execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

Now, follow the instructions on screen and choose your desired options, the script will handle the rest.

### Step 5: Check the Output üéâ

And that's it! After running the script, head over to the output folder to see your nice word clouds, graphs, and neatly formatted Markdown files. Enjoy !

### Notes

This is just a small thing I coded to help me see my convos in beautiful markdown, in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (my note-taking app).

I wasn't a fan of the clunky, and sometimes paid, chrome extensions.

I'm working on automating it to add new conversations and updating old ones. Had some luck with a JavaScript bookmarklet, still ironing it out tho. Shouldn't take long.
