### Step 2. Copy the Tool to Your Computer üì•

1. Open a program called "terminal" or "command prompt".

2. Type (and hit enter after each line):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamed-chs/chatgpt-history-export-to-md.git
```

```bash
cd chatgpt-history-export-to-md
```

This will copy this GitHub repository on your computer, and navigate to the root directory.

### Step 3: Set Up the Environment üõ†Ô∏è

**Quick setup :**

Type (and hit enter):

```bash
python setup.py
```

This will create a Python virtual environment and install the necessary python libraries.

**Activate the virtual environment :**

#### On Windows:

Using Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`):

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Or, if you're using PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If you encounter an error about script execution in PowerShell, try running:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### On Linux or MacOS:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 4: Running the Script üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

With the environment set up, you can now run the script. In the terminal or command prompt, execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

Now, follow the instructions on screen and choose your desired options, the script will handle the rest.

### Step 5: Check the Output üéâ

And that's it! After running the script, head over to the output folder to see your nice word clouds, graphs, and neatly formatted Markdown files. Enjoy !

### Notes

This is just a small thing I coded to help me see my convos in beautiful markdown, in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (my note-taking app).

I wasn't a fan of the clunky, and sometimes paid, chrome extensions.

I'm working on automating it to add new conversations and updating old ones. Had some luck with a JavaScript bookmarklet, still ironing it out tho. Shouldn't take long.
