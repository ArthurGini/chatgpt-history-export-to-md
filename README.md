Welcome to the ChatGPT Conversations to Markdown converter! This Python script helps you to convert your entire ChatGPT history and data export into neatly formatted Markdown files.

It adds **YAML** headers (_optional, included by default_), and also includes **Code interpreter** (Advanced Data Analysis) input / output.

## Quick setup

> See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). (just Python and Git and you're good to go.)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository üì•

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamed-chs/chatgpt-history-export-to-md.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory by using the following command:

```bash
cd chatgpt-history-export-to-md
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment üõ†Ô∏è

Before running the script, you need to set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

First, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On **Windows**, using `cmd.exe` (*Command Prompt*):

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

- On **Windows**, using *PowerShell*:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

- On **Linux** or **MacOS**:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

Now, install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download Your Conversations data üóÇ

Before you run the script, make sure your ChatGPT conversations are in a ZIP file format.

</details>

<hr>

The script will automatically find the most recent ZIP file in your 'Downloads' directory (in `~/Downloads/`), but you can specify a different file or location if necessary.

### Step 4: Running the Script üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

With the environment set up, you can now run the script. In the terminal or command prompt, execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

Now, follow the instructions on screen and choose your desired options, the script will handle the rest.

### Step 5: Check the Output üéâ

And that's it! After running the script, head over to the output folder to see your neatly formatted Markdown files.

- [ ] a tweet should be fun when I later add the actual data visualizations. Feel free to implement your own data visualizations [here](src/data_visualization.py), and create a pull request, then check this box (I know you want to)

### Optional: Customize the Script's behavior üåü

Using the `config.json`, you can modify the script's default parameters.

For example, set `"delimiters_default"` to `false` to replace all $\LaTeX$ bracket delimiters : `\(...\)` and `\[...\]`, with dollar sign ones : `$...$` and `$$...$$`, if you'd like your math to render beautifully in Markdown readers that support **MathJax** (like Obsidian).

### Prerequisites

<img src="images/python-logo.png" alt="Python Logo" width="70" style="margin-right: 20px;"/> <img src="images/git-logo.png" alt="Git Logo" width="70"/>

Make sure you have **Python** (version >= 3.10), and **Git** installed.
You can download them from :

- [Official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Notes

This is just a small thing I coded to help me see my convos in beautiful markdown, in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (my note-taking app).

I wasn't a fan of the clunky, and sometimes paid, chrome extensions.

I'm working on automating it to add new conversations and updating old ones. Had some luck with a JavaScript bookmarklet, still ironing it out tho. Shouldn't take long.
