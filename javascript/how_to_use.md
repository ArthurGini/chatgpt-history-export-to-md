### how to use the JS script

- Open the developer console
- First, load the JSZIP library by copy-pasting [this code](cdnjs.cloudflare.com_ajax_libs_jszip_3.10.1_jszip.min.js) in the console, and hit 'Enter'
- Then, past [this code](bookmarklet.js) and hit 'Enter'

This is a very rudimentary js script, and it needs more error handling. I've tried it on Chrome, and it works so far.
Could break at anytime if OpenAI changes their data permissions for the `/backend-api/` API.

Feel free to modify the script to your liking. Would also appreciate sharing the modified version with others here via a PR.
